# MoviesAndMe
A [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile app that uses [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to display movies informations.
* This code is not entirely from me since I mainly followed the [OpenClassroom Tutorial for React-Native](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4902061-developpez-une-application-mobile-react-native)
## How to start the project :
* With a terminal tab, go to root folder ans type ```npm start```<br><br>
You will be redirected to a page with a qr code, scan it with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your Android or<br>IOS phone or open the project in a new browser tab
